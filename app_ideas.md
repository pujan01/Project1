Which app do you wanna list ? 
Instagram

Category: Photo & Video / Social
Mobile: Website is view only, uses camera, mobile first experience.
Story: Allows users to share their lives in pictures and enhance their content with filters
Market: Anyone that takes pictures could enjoy this app. Ability to follow and hashtag based on interests and categories allows users with unique interests to engage with relevant content.
Habit: Users can post throughout the day many times. Features like “Stories” encourage more candid posting as well. Users can explore endless pictures in any category imaginable whenever they want. Very habbit forming!
Scope: Instagram started out extremely narrow focused, just posting pics and viewing feeds. Has expanded to a somewhat larger scope including “Instagram Stories” (a la SnapChat) and messenger features.


# New Ideas

1. Messaging app that combines features of Snapchat and Messenger
 - One to one chats. Screenshot notification in private chat
 - Payment Platform: split bills 

2. An app that allows people to discuss different topics and answer questions related to the topic. So, when they login they can choose a topic and will be grouped randomly, have 2 minutes to respond, and then another 2 minutes to respond to someone else's initial response. 

3. Location and food. *** Selected Idea ***
    - Mobile: It's important that this app is mobile because the weather changes frequently, and so it would be easier to check it more throug an app. 
    - Category: Fashion, Food
    - Story: Allows users to explore smart/popular food and clothes according to weather and time of the day/year, gender, age group.
    - Market: Anyone who needs a suggestion
    - Habit: Users can check it anytime they need a suggestion, throughout the day, or check for suggestions for the next day. 
    - Scope: We are gonna start with just the clothes, but we will extend to food.
